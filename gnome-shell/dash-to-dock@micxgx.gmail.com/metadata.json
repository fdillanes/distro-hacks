  "description": "Transform the dash into an intellihide dock.\n\nThis new version improves multimonitor support. For Gnome Shell 3.4 settings allow to show/hide favorites and/or running applications and to limit the maximum icon size. Now intellihide/autohide can be better configured; a fixed mode was added too. Optionally the dash can be used to change workspace by scrolling over it (disable by default). Moreover, the extension should provide basic compatibility with the bolt extension.",
